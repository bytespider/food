# Quick and easy burger sauce

This quick, and very tasty (think Big Mac sauce) burger sauce is straight
from [BBC Good Food][1] ([original recipe][2]), although I have added a little twist
based on my love for a bit of spice, and I used slightly different ingredients
based on what I had in the cupboard/fridge. If your having a burger night, your
best of making it before you start preparing the burgers, and keeping it in the
fridge until your burgers are cooked.

**Preperation time**: 1hr (5 minutes prep, refrigerate for ~1hr)

# Ingredients
_makes enough for ~4 burgers with generous servings, multiply the quanities for
more/less burgers_

- 4 tablespoons mayonnaise
- 2 teaspoons _dijon_ mustard
- 2 teaspoons tomato ketchup
- 1 tablespoon finely chopped gherkin
- 1/2 teaspoon(s) hot pepper sauce (I used Encona Hot Cajun sauce)

# Directions
1. Combine ingredients in a bowl, and put in the fridge.
2. Toast buns, and smear both sides with a generous helping of sauce
