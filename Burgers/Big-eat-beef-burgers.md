# Big eat beef burgers
Big juicy burgers topped with anything you fancy, bacon and cheese, mushrooms 
and steak sauce, or even just salad.

**Preperation time**: 30 minutes.  
**Cooking time**: 15 - 20 minutes.

# Ingredients
- 500g minced beef (not too lean)
- 4g (1 teaspoon) table salt or ground sea salt
- 4g (1 teaspoon) paprika
- 14g (1 tablespoon) finely chopped corriander leaf
- 14ml olive oil

# A little science
You’ll notice these burgers are made from a very small set of ingredients, most 
burger receipes involve eggs, flour, or breadcrumbs as a binding agent. The 
magic ingredient here is salt.

The salt begins the process of breaking down the fatty tissues in the meat and 
binding it all together.

The olive oil is there to keep the meat moist during high temprature cooking.

# Directions
1. In a medium bowl, mix the mince beef and salt with your hands. Make sure you 
work the salt in and as you mix you’ll notice the meat begining to become 
sticky.
2. Add the olive oil and seasonings and mix well. You should end up with a 
sticky ball of meat, this is the perfect consistency.
3. For added indulgence, add some grated mature cheddar.
4. To shape the burgers I use a pastry ring, however you could use a deep cookie 
cutter or a pudding can opened at both ends. Divide the meat into 4 and press 
the meat down.
5. Cooking is best done in a way where the fat can easily run away, such as a
griddle or under the grill. If you’re using a griddle heat the pan to smoking 
hot before adding the first burger then turn down to a medium heat.
6. Whilst cooking try to drain as much of the fat off as you can.
7. Flip the burger over after 8-10 mins, the outside will have crisp chargril 
marks.
8. After the second side is cooked, you’ll want to add any hot toppings then 
serve in a sturdy bun or deli roll.
